# Mapbox GL JS Preview

Set your Mapbox Access Token in `Preferences` > `Settings` > `Mapbox: Preview` > `Token`.

Open a `style.json` in editor and use `Cmd + Shift + P` > `Mapbox: Preview` to open the preview.

Make sure the style you're opening is inside your current workspace, the extension prohibits the webview from accessing anything outside of it
